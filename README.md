## Overview

Prometheus is a frontier exploration package in ROS. This was developed as a part of ENPM808X Software Development course at the University of Maryland, College Park.
Frontier exploration is the method of exploring unknown environments. Prometheus uses the turtlebot platform for simulation and implementing the frontier exploration 
package. 

## Development Process

We will use pair programming for all the design and development purpose. The planning and development of this module has been split into three sprints of a week each. 
The product backlog, work log and iteration log can be found in the link below. Test Driven Development approach is taken for implementation and unit testing. 
This will enable us to complete the project in defined time. At the end, we will have report of actual time and planned time difference. This will enable future ventures 
to plan correctly.
